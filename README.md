Hi, I’m @ThatOneGuy-314.
I’m interested in JavaScript, TI-Basic, C, and (e)z80 Assembly; I’m currently learning the latter two.
I own a TI 84 Plus CE, a TI 83 Plus, and a (sadly now bricked ☹️) TI Nspire CX.
As of now, I know 101 digits of pi (I'll probably know more in the future but I'm definitely gonna forget to update this readme).
If you need to know anything else about me, you're not going to find it here.
