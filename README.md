Hi, I’m @ThatOneGuy-314.
I’m interested in JavaScript, C, TI-Basic, and TI Assembly; I’m currently learning the latter two.
I own a TI 84 Plus CE, a TI 83 Plus, and a TI Nspire CX (Although its OS is too high to run Ndless).
As of now, I know 101 digits of pi (I'll probably know more in the future but I'm definitely gonna forget to update this readme).
If you need to know anything else about me, you're probably a stalker, so I'm cutting this off with that.
